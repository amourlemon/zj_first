Abstract—The click-through conversion rate prediction has always been an important direction of the e-commerce platform. This
paper proposes a prediction model of the click-through conversion rate based on feature combination and representation learning
around the three elements of the Buyer-Book-Activity(BBA) e-commerce platform, considering the object characteristics of the book
e-commerce platform. First, we create a three-part BBA diagram of user-book-marketing activity based on the three elements of the
e-commerce platform, to completely describe the book e-commerce platform information space. We build a complete feature space
using a method for factor decomposer-based large-scale feature combination information mining based on the BBA. In particular, for
the hidden rich book text information, we propose book2tag book text features and then decompose them. Second, to represent the
overall information space of the book e-commerce platform, this paper proposes the BBA2vec representation learning method to
represent the complexity and diversity of the BBA effective data feature space, given that feature combination cannot completely
achieve the diversity of e-commerce features. Finally, a deep neural network is used to predict click-through conversion rate by
combining feature combination and feature representation. The experimental results show that the model accurately predicts the
bookstore e-commerce platform’s click purchase conversion rate.
